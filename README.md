# Simplest Three.js, Typescript & Webpack Setup
I use this setup as a Playground for Three.js with the benefit to have type hinting.
## Steps:

Yarn:

`yarn run start`

NPM:

`npm run start`


This starts webpack in watch mode ad compiles into `/dist/bundle.js`.

Then start VSCodes Live-Server (Extension has to be installed). I intentionally dismised webpack-live-server because I want to keep it as simple as possible.
